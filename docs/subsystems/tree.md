# tree (`@flybot/tree`)

Recursive Bot hierarchy plugin (Chief as root, children, send middleware `tree`) lives entirely under `plugins/tree/`.

## Owns

Everything in `plugins/tree/` (entry `plugins/tree/index.js` and any helpers).

## Does not own

- Plugin runtime hooks/slots → [plugin-runtime](plugin-runtime.md).
- Core server/client → [ds-bot-core](ds-bot-core.md).
- Cross-owner authority policy → [team](team.md). Chief as tree root is the identity anchor for that contract; tree ownership itself stays on this page.

## Key files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `plugins/tree/index.js` | Plugin entry. |

## Entry points

- `plugins/tree/index.js` — loaded as `@flybot/tree`.

## Invariants

1. Tree code stays inside `plugins/tree/`; no edits to `ds-bot/` or `core/src/`.
2. Uses documented plugin APIs only (hooks/slots).

## Tests

Covered by the plugin's own tests under `plugins/tree/` / core test suite as wired.

## Common mistakes

- Placing tree logic in `core/` instead of `plugins/tree/`.
- Bypassing the plugin runtime for registration.
