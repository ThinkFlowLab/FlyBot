# social (`@flybot/social`)

Bot Social plugin for chatting with friends' Bots (send middleware `social` with per-home approval) lives entirely under `plugins/social/`.

## Owns

Everything in `plugins/social/` (entry `plugins/social/index.js` and any helpers).

## Does not own

- Plugin runtime hooks/slots → [plugin-runtime](plugin-runtime.md).
- Core server/client → [ds-bot-core](ds-bot-core.md).
- Standalone `core/web-search.js` (not part of social).

## Key files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `plugins/social/index.js` | Plugin entry. |

## Entry points

- `plugins/social/index.js` — loaded as `@flybot/social`.

## Invariants

1. Social code stays inside `plugins/social/`.
2. Uses documented plugin APIs only.

## Tests

Covered by the plugin's own tests under `plugins/social/` / core test suite as wired.

## Common mistakes

- Putting social logic under `core/`.
- Assuming social owns `web-search.js`.
